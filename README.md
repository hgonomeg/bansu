# Bansu

Server-side computation API for [Moorhen](https://github.com/moorhen-coot/Moorhen).

## Design

This is an early prototype. Design will be described when it matures a bit.

## Name

The name is supposed to mean "Moorhen's Nest" in Japanese.

The kanji for "Moorhen" is "[鷭](https://jisho.org/word/%E9%B7%AD-1)".[^1]

The kanji for "nest" is "巣".

Combined together gives us:

<ruby>
<rb>鷭</rb>
<rt>ban</rt>
<rb>巣</rb>
<rt>su</rt>
</ruby>


[^1]: Note: A Japanese person will likely not recognize this character. It's rarely used.
