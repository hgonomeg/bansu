# Bansu

Server-side computation API for [Moorhen](https://github.com/moorhen-coot/Moorhen).

## Design

### Description

The server allows you to spawn jobs using HTTP POST requests.
Each job gets assigned an ID (being an UUID) which can later be used
to trace the job's progress and to get the computation results.

You can trace job progress by listening on a web socket connection (documented below).

The ID of your job will be valid for the following amount of time:

```
2 * T
```

where `T` is the timeout value associated with a given job type.

The (current) default timeout for `Acedrg` is 2 minutes.

### Configuration

The following environment variables control the behavior of the server:

* `TMPDIR` - can be used to specify location where jobs store temporary files
* `BANSU_PORT` - sets the port to listen on
* `BANSU_ADDRESS` - sets the address to listen on

### API

The server exposes the following API:

### HTTP POST `/run_acedrg`

Creates `Acedrg` job.
Accepts the following JSON payload:

```json
{
    "smiles": "Your SMILES string",
    /// An array of additional arguments passed to acedrg
    "commandline_args: ["-z", "--something"]
}
```

Replies with the following JSON:

```json
{
    /// Null on error
    "job_id": "UUID of your job",
    /// Null on success
    "error_message": "Error message if the request failed"
}
```

Returns:
* `201 Created` on success
* `500 Internal Server Error` on error

### WEBSOCKET (HTTP GET) `/ws/{job_id}`

Opens a websocket connection which allows you to track the job's progress.
Progress reports have the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "status": "Pending | Finished | Failed",
    /// Will be null if the job is still pending, if it timed-out
    /// or the child process failed due to an I/O error
    "job_output": {
        "stdout": "A string",
        "stderr": "A string"
    },
    /// Only not-null if the job failed
    "failure_reason": "TimedOut | AcedrgError | IOError"
}

```

Currently, progress messages are sent only when the connection opens and when the job either fails or completes successfully.

The connection ignores all messages sent to it.

Returns `404 Not Found` if the given `job_id` is not valid.


### HTTP GET `/get_cif/{job_id}`

For Acedrg jobs, streams the contents of the CIF file generated by Acedrg.

Returns:
* `200 OK` on success
* `404 Not Found` if the given `job_id` is not valid.
* `500 Internal Server Error` if the output file could not be read
* `400 Bad Request` if the given `job_id` does is not an `Acedrg` job or if the job is still pending


## Name

The name is supposed to mean "Moorhen's Nest" in Japanese.

The kanji for "Moorhen" is "[鷭](https://jisho.org/word/%E9%B7%AD-1)".[^1]

The kanji for "nest" is "巣".

Combined together gives us:

<ruby>
<rb>鷭</rb>
<rt>ban</rt>
<rb>巣</rb>
<rt>su</rt>
</ruby>


[^1]: Note: A Japanese person will likely not recognize this character. It's rarely used.

## Todo

* Isolating jobs in containers
* Input validation!!!
* Support for servalcat
* Think about API design for defining graph-like pipelines (if we ever need that)
